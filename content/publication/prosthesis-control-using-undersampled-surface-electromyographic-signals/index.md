abstract: Amputations can result in disability, permanent physical injury, and
  even posttraumatic stress disorder. Upper extremity amputations are mostly
  work-related, and such injuries include about 7% of the total burden of
  disease. High-functional artificial limbs are not available to most amputees
  because of their high price and the lack of public health coverage. Thus,
  there has been a significant interest in the design and fabrication of
  low-cost active upper-limb prostheses. Such devices are usually controlled by
  surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals. Recently, portable, low-cost
  recording devices such as Thalmic Labs Myo Gesture Control Armband have been
  used in the movement detection. Such devices use undersampled sEMG signals. In
  this chapter, we discuss upper-limb prostheses and their control. We further
  provide the results of some experiments showing that such undersampled signals
  could be used for various applications required in advanced prosthesis
  control, e.g., force prediction, elbow angle prediction, movement detection,
  and time and frequency parameter extraction using undersampled sEMG signals.
  Finally, a low-cost controller for BRUNEL HAND 2.0 from Open Bionics is
  designed to link low-cost recording and prosthesis.
